# AdventOfCode2020

My Implementation of 2020's Advent of Code. 

This is an event that provides daily programming challenges to complete for fun. Let's see how I get on! 

The code for each individual daily challenge can be found in a branch named after the day. The code written for each day will be merged into the main branch as quite often daily challenges build of previous days. 

Day 1
- [x] Task 1
- [x] Task 2

Day 2
- [x] Task 1
- [x] Task 2

Day 3
- [x] Task 1
- [x] Task 2
